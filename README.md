# GoPHY

This is a development toolkit for phylogenetics. There are many different main packages that are typically in subdirectories. So, for example, the bipartition analyzer is in `gophy/bp/` and is called `bp.go`. To get this code and compile things, just do `go get github.com/FePhyFoFum/gophy`. Then you can build it with `go build github.com/FePhyFoFum/gophy/bp/bp.go`. There are other mains in other subdirectories with more to come.
