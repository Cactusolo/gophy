# GoPHY

This is a toy package at the moment to try some things out in go that pertain to phylogenetics (tree and sequence operations). There are many different main packages that are typically in subdirectories. So, for example, the bipartition analyzer is in `gophy/bp/` and is called `bp.go`. You can build it with `go build gophy/bp/bp.go`. There are other mains in other subdirectories with more to come.
