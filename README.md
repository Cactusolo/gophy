# GoPHY

This is a toy package at the moment to try some things out in go that pertain to phylogenetics (tree and sequence operations). There are many different main packages that are typically in subdirectories. So, for example, the bipartition analyzer is in `gophy/bp/` and is called `bp.go`. To get this code and compile things, just do `go get github.com/FePhyFoFum/gophy`. Then you can build it with `go build github.com/FePhyFoFum/gophy/bp/bp.go`. There are other mains in other subdirectories with more to come.
